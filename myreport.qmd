# Unlocking Education: The Journey Behind School Attendance

The First Step: Mapping a Child's Right

Education is the doorway to opportunity, yet millions are still left standing outside that door.Around the world, school attendance rates tell a powerful story — a story of inclusion, struggle, and progress.To begin, let's take a global view. Where are children making it into the classroom — and where are they being left behind?

```{python}
fig = px.choropleth(
    latest_df,
    locations="alpha_3_code",
    color="obs_value",
    hover_name="country",
    color_continuous_scale=palette,
    title=f"School Attendance Rate - {latest_year}"
)
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
fig.show()
```

This map paints a striking picture: Some nations shine brightly, nearing full enrollment, while others reveal heartbreaking gaps, reminding us of the unevenness in access to learning.

## Boys and Girls: Are We Closing the Gap?

While access has improved, gender disparities remain in many regions. How do boys' and girls' school attendance rates compare?

```{python}
male = df[df["sex"] == "Male"]
female = df[df["sex"] == "Female"]

male_latest = male[male["time_period"] == latest_year][["country", "obs_value"]].rename(columns={"obs_value": "Male"})
female_latest = female[female["time_period"] == latest_year][["country", "obs_value"]].rename(columns={"obs_value": "Female"})

gender_df = pd.merge(male_latest, female_latest, on="country")

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.regplot(data=gender_df, x="Male", y="Female", scatter_kws={"s":50, "alpha":0.6}, line_kws={"color": palette[4]})
plt.grid(True, linestyle="--", alpha=0.6)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

> In an ideal world, every dot would fall perfectly on the diagonal line — signaling equality. Yet reality shows us deviations:
>
> -   In some nations, girls still lag behind.
>
> -   In others, boys are increasingly vulnerable to dropout.
>
> -   Understanding these differences is crucial for shaping targeted, inclusive education policies.

## A Deeper Dive: How Some Countries Are Changing Over Time

Progress isn’t measured only by snapshots — but by journeys.Take, for instance, **Afghanistan**. A nation marked by decades of turmoil, yet striving to move forward.

```{python}
afg = df_total[df_total["country"] == "Afghanistan"]

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.lineplot(data=afg, x="time_period", y="obs_value", marker="o", color=palette[7])
plt.grid(True, linestyle="--", alpha=0.6)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

While fluctuations remain, the overall picture reveals resilience.Every year of improvement represents thousands more children learning, dreaming, and building toward a different future.

## Rising Together: Stories of Momentum

Beyond individual nations, we can observe the **collective movement** of countries making major strides.

```{python}
top3 = latest_df.sort_values("obs_value", ascending=False).head(3)["country"]
area_df = df_total[df_total["country"].isin(top3)]

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
for i, c in enumerate(top3):
    sub = area_df[area_df["country"] == c]
    plt.fill_between(sub["time_period"], sub["obs_value"], alpha=0.5, color=palette[i], label=c)

plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, linestyle="--", alpha=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This area chart shows not only how top-performing countries have improved — but also the sheer momentum behind educational growth when communities, governments, and families come together.It reminds us that while the starting points differ, progress is possible everywhere.

## Final Reflections: More Than Numbers

Behind every data point we have seen lies a child's story —A story of hope, perseverance, and potential.Education is not a luxury.It is the engine of healthier societies, stronger economies, and more peaceful nations.As we visualize these global patterns, we must remember:**Each additional child stepping into a classroom brings the entire world closer to a brighter tomorrow.**
